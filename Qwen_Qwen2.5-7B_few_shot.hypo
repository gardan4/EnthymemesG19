The widespread availability of free online resources has significantly impacted higher education, particularly in terms of the cost and accessibility of information. As the internet provides this kind of information for free, it shifts the financial burden from institutions to individual students and families. This shift can lead to increased tuition fees and other costs associated with education, making higher education less accessible and more expensive for many students.

Additionally, the rise of online education platforms could further disrupt traditional models of higher education, potentially leading to a decline in the relevance and value of certain humanities programs if they cannot adapt to these changes. Therefore, it is crucial for colleges to consider how to balance the benefits of digital resources with the need to maintain high-quality humanities programs that
