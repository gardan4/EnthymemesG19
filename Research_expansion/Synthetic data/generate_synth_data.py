PROMPT = "Give me a short argument, no longer than 3 sentences. Then give me the same sentence but for one crucial difference: a part of the argument has been removed, specifically one that tends to be understood by people implicitly. For example, provide me with a sentence like 'The concept of standardized testing aims to provide a uniform measure across different schools and regions to evaluate student performance on common standards. And since these tests are just one aspect of educational assessment, it's logical that they contribute only partially to overall academic grades (often around 20% weighting).' Then, also provide me another sentence like: 'The concept of standardized testing aims to provide a uniform measure across different schools and regions to evaluate student performance on common standards. # It's logical that they contribute only partially to overall academic grades (often around 20% weighting).' Notice how they are identical, except for the fact part of the first sentence has been replaced by a '#'. This part is not crucial to state explicitly for the reader to make sense of the argument. I want your response to be in the following format: First, the original argument. Then the same argument except a part has been replaced by a '#' as shown in my example. The argument should concern a random topic. ADD NO OTHER TEXT TO YOUR RESPONSE!"
